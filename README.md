### Hi there! I am Sankalp ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**sankalpg10/sankalpg10** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am a graduate student in the Computer Science department at NC State University, Raleigh, NC.


I strive to build innovative, scalable, and sustainable software solutions to solve problems and answer questions through computational logic. I am genuinely fascinated by how one can adaptively plan to solve any problem, and iteratively dismantle ambiguity around even the most esoteric challenges.

I love developing end-to-end software tools ( read solutions to save the world) predominantly through Python, Java, and JavaScript. My skillset includes web engineering tools such as Node.JS, ASP.Net, ReactJS, Angular, jQuery, MySQL, MongoDB, and data Engineering tools such as Scikit-learn, SciPy, NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, PyTorch.

I am seeking full-time opportunities to grow in the domains of Software Engineering, DevOps, and Machine Learning.

Always happy to make productive connections. You can contact me at sankalpgaharwar@gmail.com or check out my LinkedIn Profile (https://www.linkedin.com/in/sankalpgaharwar/)
